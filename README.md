# CryptoPortfolioGUI

A simple GUI that displays a cryptocurrency portfolio. The amount of each currency still needs to be entered manually into the script. Features
implemented so far include a button that displays a pie chart and an update button which gathers live data from an API. Still a work in progress. Work in progress!!!!!!

Features to implement:
Get input from user on which coins they want to 'enter'.
Save values in some sort of database or maybe just a csv file since this is fairly simple.
